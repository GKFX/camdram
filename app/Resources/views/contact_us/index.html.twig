<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>Camdram is run solely by volunteers. We are here to help, but it's not always possible for us to respond
    rapidly. Please check our <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_faq') }}">frequently asked questions</a> (FAQ)
    page before contacting us.
</p>

<p>We continuously monitor Camdram so if you got an error message, chances are that we already know! However
    if you've found something that isn't working right, please create an 'issue' on our
    <a href="http://github.com/camdram/camdram/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page (external website).
    You will automatically receive email notifications when someone is working on the issue and when it is fixed.
    See <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_development') }}">here</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>Please only use the form on this page to contact us regarding any queries or problems that you have which
    relate specifically to the Camdram web site. Remember that we operate as a third-party service that anyone
    can use and that we typically have very little if any contact with our users. A large variety of people,
    societies, venues and organisation list their shows and vacancies on Camdram and it would be impractical
    for us to keep abreast of everything that goes on. If you have a query regarding a specific show, a
    particular venue or a given funding society then it would be better addressed to that body rather than us.
    Similarly we are poorly placed to offer generic advice on getting involved with theatre in Cambridge.
</p>

<p>For anything else, if the FAQ page didn't help, please fill in the form below and we'll get back to you as
    soon as we can. Alternatively, you can email <a href="mailto:support@camdram.net">support@camdram.net</a>.
