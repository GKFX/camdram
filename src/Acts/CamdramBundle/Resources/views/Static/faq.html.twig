        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p>
        We hope that Camdram is easy to use, but sometimes our users have a few
        questions. We've put some answers to our most frequently asked questions
        below. If you have a question that hasn't been answered below, then you
        can <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">contact us</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>My name has been misspelt, can you change it?</h3>

        <p>
        Details on Camdram are all added by our users. For most shows it's either
        the producer or director who adds this information: please contact them
        if you want something changing. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>I'm listed under two different names, what do I do?</h3>
        <p>
        That one's easy, just <a href="{{ path('acts_camdram_contact_us') }}">let us know</a>
        which entries are duplicates and we'll sort that for you.
        </p>

        <h3>I'm on a society committee, how do I edit the society's page on Camdram?</h3>
        <p>
        Logged-in Camdram users can be given special rights to control a society's
        page, and to authorise submitted show listings that are produced by that society.
        These rights can be passed on from user to user; if you don't have them and you
        think you should, speak to others on your committee or the outgoing committee as
        one or more of them should have the rights.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I buy tickets for your show?</h3>

        <p>
        Camdram is not directly involved with any of the shows we list.
        Tickets can usually be bought from the performance venue. 
        Some of the most commonly used venues for student shows are listed below:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.adctheatre.com/">ADC Theatre</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.corpusplayroom.com/">Corpus Playroom</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.westroad.org/">West Road Concert Hall</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>I've written a fantastic new play, would you like to buy the rights?</h3>

        <p>
